# Incident: 2025-04-08 13-00-00

## Summary
Between 13:00 and 13:25 UTC on 2025-04-08, users encountered failed pizza order attempts despite having proper authorization. The issue originated from the Pizza Factory microservice during an active chaos test scenario. The factory service deliberately injected failure responses via its Chaos Monkey system. While no actual users were impacted in production, the authorization logs and metric alerts indicated degraded behavior. The issue was resolved within 10 minutes by reporting the fix code to the factory endpoint.

This was a low-severity test incident with no customer impact, intended to validate our observability and error-handling capabilities.



## Detection
This incident was detected through an increase in failed authorized POST requests to the /api/order endpoint, visible via Grafana metrics and logs. Additionally, the following log entry confirmed the presence of a factory-induced failure:
'''

Copy
Edit
{
  "authorized": true,
  "path": "/",
  "method": "POST",
  "statusCode": 500,
  "reqBody": "{\"franchiseId\":1,\"storeId\":1,\"items\":[{\"menuId\":1,\"description\":\"Veggie\",\"price\":0.05}]}",
  "resBody": "{\"message\":\"Failed to fulfill order at factory\",\"reportPizzaCreationErrorToPizzaFactoryUrl\":\"https://cs329.cs.byu.edu/api/report?apiKey=...&fixCode=...\"}"
}
'''
The presence of reportPizzaCreationErrorToPizzaFactoryUrl in the response indicated that this was a planned chaos injection.

## Impact

For approximately 25 minutes, internal users of the JWT Pizza Service experienced simulated failures when submitting pizza orders. This affected only test environments, with no real customers impacted.

Affected endpoints: POST /api/order

Symptoms: HTTP 500 errors returned from the factory

Monitoring: Alerts appeared in Grafana based on failed request metrics



## Timeline

13:00 — Authorization logs show a sudden increase in failed POST /api/order attempts

13:10 — Logs confirm 500 status codes from the Pizza Factory

13:24 — I identifies chaos monkey URL in the response using curl

'''
curl -X POST https://pizza-factory.cs329.click/api/order -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer b53f754c5af24bde8017f97ff1ac19c8' -d '{"test": true}'
'''

13:25 — I sends recovery curl request to the chaos fix URL:

## Response

The incident was investigated and resolved by the on-call Alex.U within minutes of detection. Once the chaos monkey URL was identified, the engineer reported the fix code to the appropriate endpoint, resolving the simulation.

## Root cause

The pizza-factory was creating the authorization error.

## Resolution

Chaos was resolved by sending a curl request to the provided recovery endpoint:
'''
curl -X POST https://pizza-factory.cs329.click/api/order -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Authorization: Bearer b53f754c5af24bde8017f97ff1ac19c8' -d '{"test": true}'
'''


## Action items

1. Improve error response messaging to clarify intentional failures vs system faults
